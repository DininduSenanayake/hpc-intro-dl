## Workshop material copy

This workshop material comes with a set of example scripts and notebook.
You should have a copy of it waiting for you in the workshop folder, let's check this.

It is located in the folder `/nesi/project/nesi99991/20240314__hpc_intro_dl/$USER`, where `$USER` stands for your NeSI login.

Let's move to this folder and check the content using:

```bash
cd /nesi/project/nesi99991/20240314__hpc_intro_dl/$USER
ls -l .
```

!!! info

    If, by any chance, you don't have a copy of the workshop material on the system, you can create one yourself using the following commands:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nesi/hpc-intro-dl.git /nesi/project/nesi99991/20240314__hpc_intro_dl/$USER
